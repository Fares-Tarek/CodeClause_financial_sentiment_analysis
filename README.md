Financial Sentiment Analysis

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on financial data using machine learning techniques. The goal is to accurately classify sentiments expressed in financial text data, providing valuable insights into market sentiment, investor behavior, and potential market trends.

Project Overview
The project follows these key steps:

Data Preparation: The financial data, such as news articles, social media posts, and earnings reports, is collected and preprocessed. Text cleaning and normalization techniques are applied to prepare the data for analysis.

Feature Engineering: The preprocessed text data is transformed into numerical features using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization technique. This conversion captures the relative importance of words in sentiment analysis.

Model Training: A machine learning model, specifically a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, is trained on the transformed features. The SVM algorithm is known for its ability to handle high-dimensional data and effectively classify text into sentiment categories.

Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using a test set, and performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to classify sentiments accurately.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Grid search is used to find the optimal hyperparameters for the SVM classifier, such as n-gram range, C parameter, and gamma parameter. This tuning process aims to improve the model's performance by identifying the best combination of hyperparameters.
